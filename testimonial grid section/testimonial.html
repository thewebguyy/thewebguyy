              <p class="font-weight-bolder brief1" style="font-size: 1.4rem;">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</p>
    
              <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;" class="review1">‚ÄúI was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.‚Äù</p>

              <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;" class="review2"> ‚ÄúI started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I‚Äôve made in myself.‚Äù</p>

              <p class="font-weight-bolder brief4" style="font-size: 1.4rem;">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
    
              <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;" class="review4"> ‚ÄúThe staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.‚Äù</p>

          <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;" class=" review5">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
